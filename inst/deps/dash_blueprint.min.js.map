Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

It's built upon the\n * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)\n * component, so it inherits all of its props.\n *\n * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,\n * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a\n * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSSS transition. After the\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\n * transition state.\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\"my-node\">\n *         <div>\n *           {\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\"}\n *         </div>\n *       </CSSTransition>\n *       <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick\n * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and\n * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after\n * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate\n * _appearance_.\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-node-enter {\n *   opacity: 0;\n * }\n * .my-node-enter-active {\n *   opacity: 1;\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit {\n *   opacity: 1;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit-active {\n *   opacity: 0;\n *   transition: opacity: 200ms;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**.\n */\n\n\nvar CSSTransition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(CSSTransition, _React$Component);\n\n  function CSSTransition() {\n    var _this;\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n\n    _this.onEnter = function (node, appearing) {\n      var _this$getClassNames = _this.getClassNames(appearing ?

Otherwise you can\n   * simply use `fade-enter-done` for defining both cases.\n   *\n   * Each individual classNames can also be specified independently like:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * classNames={{\n   *  appear: 'my-appear',\n   *  appearActive: 'my-active-appear',\n   *  appearDone: 'my-done-appear',\n   *  enter: 'my-enter',\n   *  enterActive: 'my-active-enter',\n   *  enterDone: 'my-done-enter',\n   *  exit: 'my-exit',\n   *  exitActive: 'my-active-exit',\n   *  exitDone: 'my-done-exit',\n   * }}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * If you want to set these classes using CSS Modules:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * import styles from './styles.css';\n   * ```\n   *\n   * you might want to use camelCase in your CSS file, that way could simply\n   * spread them instead of listing them one by one:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * classNames={{ ...styles }}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @type {string | {\n   *  appear?: string,\n   *  appearActive?: string,\n   *  appearDone?: string,\n   *  enter?: string,\n   *  enterActive?: string,\n   *  enterDone?: string,\n   *  exit?: string,\n   *  exitActive?: string,\n   *  exitDone?: string,\n   * }}\n   */\n  classNames: _PropTypes.classNamesShape,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'enter' or 'appear' class is\n   * applied.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement, isAppearing: bool)\n   */\n  onEnter: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'enter-active' or\n   * 'appear-active' class is applied.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement, isAppearing: bool)\n   */\n  onEntering: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'enter' or\n   * 'appear' classes are **removed** and the `done` class is added to the DOM node.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement, isAppearing: bool)\n   */\n  onEntered: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'exit' class is\n   * applied.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement)\n   */\n  onExit: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'exit-active' is applied.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement)\n   */\n  onExiting: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'exit' classes\n   * are **removed** and the `exit-done` class is added to the DOM node.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement)\n   */\n  onExited: PropTypes.func\n}) : {};\nvar _default = CSSTransition;\nexports.default = _default;\nmodule.exports = exports[\"default\"];","\"use strict\";\n\nvar _interopRequireDefault = require(\"@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault\");\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\nexports.default = addClass;\n\nvar _hasClass = _interopRequireDefault(require(\"./hasClass\"));\n\nfunction addClass(element, className) {\n  if (element.classList) element.classList.add(className);else if (!(0, _hasClass.default)(element, className)) if (typeof element.className === 'string') element.className = element.className + ' ' + className;else element.setAttribute('class', (element.className && element.className.baseVal || '') + ' ' + className);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = exports[\"default\"];","function _interopRequireDefault(obj) {\n  return obj && obj.__esModule ?
